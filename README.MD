# Advent of Code 2024 Rust Solutions

## About

Journal to document my Advent of Code solutions, with the aim to maximise my learning in Rust and Algorithms.

I usually have a different goal for each day's problem. To better document my thinking on what I was trying to practice/ learn from the day's problem, I tried to write a Commentary for each day.

TODO write commentaries for earlier days to share my thinking.

## How to run

Every day's solution is written as a separate binary crate. Run it like so:

`cargo run --bin <day_XX>` e.g., `cargo run --bin day_01`

The only reason I'm doing it like this is because I recently learnt that you can actually have _multiple_ binary crates in a package. Wow.
